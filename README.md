# 3-Bit-Asynchronous-Graycode-Upcounter
The designed system features a 3-bit asynchronous gray code up counter accompanied by a well-structured testbench. Comprising a 3-bit binary counter and a dedicated conversion block, this counter employs asynchronous operation to increment in gray code sequence. The binary counter's output seamlessly interfaces with the conversion block, which transforms the binary count into the corresponding gray code representation. The diligently crafted testbench ensures comprehensive validation of the counter's functionality, including accurate gray code conversion and seamless bit-by-bit progression. This combined design provides a reliable solution for efficiently counting in gray code while adhering to asynchronous principles.
